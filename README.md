Backend: Golang

Reference implementation for a Go backend. This was supposed to be all gleam but I'm much faster at Go for now.

Frontend: Golang (ebitengine)


# gleam

I don't know anything about Gleam so all of the Gleam code is in various states of progress.
Heavily based on github.com/chouzar/luster since I'm a Gleam n00b

Maybe will rewrite in Gleam someday.
